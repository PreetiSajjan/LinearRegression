# LinearRegression
Implementation of Linear Regression from scratch in Python

Results: 
Below are the results for implemented logistic regression after repeating the process 10 times with a random division of 2/3 train data and 1/3 test data. 
Accuracies for 10 times run: 92.53731343283582, 95.52238805970148, 92.53731343283582, 95.52238805970148, 94.02985074626866, 91.04477611940298, 97.01492537313433, 94.02985074626866, 97.01492537313433, 95.52238805970148 
Average Accuracy: 94.47761194029852 % 

Similarly, below are the results for scikit-learn logistic regression after repeating the process for 10 times along with their mean:
